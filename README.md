## 🌟 Project Overview
A modern twist on classic Pacman featuring:
- **Competitive two-player mode** with score tracking
- **Dynamic map regeneration** every 30 seconds
- **Intelligent ghosts** using multiple AI algorithms (A*, BFS, Min-Max, Genetic Algorithm)
- **New power-ups** like ghost freezing
- **Adaptive gameplay** with multiple win conditions

## 🚀 Key Features
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🕹️ Dual Players | Compete head-to-head as Pacman characters |
| 🧠 Smart Ghosts | AI-driven enemies with pathfinding strategies |
| 🗺️ Living Maze | Map reshapes dynamically during gameplay |
| ⏳ Ghost Freeze | Temporary power-up to evade capture |
| 🏆 Multiple Win Conditions | Score-based or survival-based victory |

## 🎯 Game Rules

### 🎮 Players:
- Control Pacman characters using **Arrow** or **WASD** keys
- **Collect pellets** to increase your score

### 👻 Ghosts:
- Controlled by **AI algorithms** to chase Pacmen
- Can be **frozen temporarily** using power-ups

### 🏆 Winning:
- **Ghosts win** if both Pacmen are caught
- **Last surviving Pacman wins** if one remains
- **Highest scorer wins** if all pellets are eaten
